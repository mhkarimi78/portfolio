      I have extensive experience working with a variety of architectural and design software. Through my academic projects and professional work, I've developed expertise in 3D modeling, rendering, and visualization. I'm proficient in using these tools to create innovative and sustainable designs, and I'm always eager to explore new techniques and technologies in architectural visualization.
